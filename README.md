# CI/CD Pipeline – Real-World DevOps Workflow

## 🧠 Summary

This project documents a real-world CI/CD pipeline I have built and managed over the past 4 years as a DevOps professional. These handwritten notes represent a complete end-to-end automation pipeline, showcasing how I have used industry-standard tools in production to ensure code quality, security, and continuous delivery.

## 📷 Notes

> These are raw notes taken from my own experience and used as a reference during team discussions and pipeline setups.

## ⚙️ Tools & Stages

### 1. 🧾 Planning & Coding
- **Jira/Ticket System** – For requirement tracking and task assignments.
- **Local Development** – Code is written and tested by developers before being committed.

### 2. 🚀 Pipeline Automation (CI/CD)

| Stage | Tool | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Code Push** | GitHub | Developers push code to a remote repository |
| **Trigger CI/CD** | Jenkins | Pipeline triggered on code push |
| **Build & Test** | Maven | Compiles code and runs unit tests |
| **Code Quality** | SonarQube | Analyzes code for bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities |
| **Security Scan** | Aqua/Trivy | Scans Docker images for known vulnerabilities |
| **Artifact Build** | Maven | Packages and creates the build artifact |
| **Artifact Store** | Nexus Repository | Stores artifacts for later deployment |
| **Dockerize** | Docker | Creates Docker images and pushes to Docker Hub or private registry |
| **Deploy** | Kubernetes | Application is deployed to Kubernetes cluster |
| **Security Check** | kubeaudit | Scans the cluster for misconfigurations and security issues |

### 3. 📩 Notifications
- **Mail Notifications** – Pipeline sends success/failure updates to stakeholders.

---

### 4. 🔍 Monitoring

- **Website-Level Monitoring** (e.g., Blackbox Exporter):
  - Checks if the site is up
  - Monitors traffic and uptime

- **System-Level Monitoring**:
  - CPU, RAM usage
  - Infrastructure health

- **Visualization Tool**:
  - All monitoring data visualized in **Grafana**

---

## 📌 Outcome

The entire pipeline ensures that:
- Code meets quality and security standards
- Builds are automated, repeatable, and deployable
- Feedback is quick through notifications
- System and application health is always visible
